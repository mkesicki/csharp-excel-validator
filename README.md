# ExcelValidator
This is just to play with C# and Threads. The idea is like: [https://github.com/mkesicki/excel_validator/]
but in *C#* and will try to use Threads to parse file. This is just a fun exercise.  

## Usage 
```
$ ./ExcelValidator.exe
 You need to pass 2 parametrs:
 - path to Excel file
 - path to yaml config file with validation rules

$ ./ExcelValidator.exe excel.xlsx config.yaml
```
