# ExcelValidator
This is just to play with C# and Threads. The idea is same as: [https://github.com/mkesicki/excel_validator/]
but written in *C#*. This version is using Threads to speed up process. It is fun exercise and only very basic validation is added. If you like please extend :)

## Usage 
```
$ ./ExcelValidator.exe
 You need to pass 2 parametrs:
 - path to Excel file
 - path to yaml config file with validation rules

$ ./ExcelValidator.exe excel.xlsx config.yaml
```
